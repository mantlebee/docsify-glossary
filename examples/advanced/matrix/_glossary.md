# Matrix Glossary

## Blue Pill

A bluepill refers to a human that is not aware of the true nature of the Matrix. Bluepills typically have their bodies and minds remain semi-permanently connected to the power plant.

The term is also synonymous with _coppertop_ (a reference to the _Duracell_ brand of disposable chemical batteries and an inference to a pod-human's primary use: power generation for the Machines).

## Morpheus

Morpheus is a Zion operative who serves in the city's defense force against attack from the Machines. His hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar, has far less armament than its sister craft. As with all hovercraft, the _Neb_ is equipped with an EMP weapon to disable any sentinels that they encounter.

## Neo

Neo is a former bluepill rescued by Morpheus together with the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar. As a redpill, he was prophesied by The Oracle to be The One and was set out on a course to free humanity from the Matrix and to ultimately end the centuries-long Machine War.

## Red Pill

The term redpill refers to a human that is aware of the true nature of the Matrix. Redpills are typically humans whose bodies and minds have been freed from the power plant by Zion hovercraft teams, but humans still connected to the Matrix can also be aware of its reality. Usually, Redpills encounter anomalies or glitches in the system, or may free themselves from physical bonds by exceeding human limitations. In either of these cases, other Redpills find them and offer them freedom.
