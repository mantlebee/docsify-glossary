# The Matrix

Morpheus delivers this monologue to Neo as he explains to him how the Matrix works, and how to escape it.

> That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.

long pause, sighs.

> Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.

In his left hand, Morpheus shows a blue pill.

> You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

A red pill is shown in his other hand.

> You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.

Long pause; Neo begins to reach for the red pill.

> Remember -- all I am offering is the truth, nothing more.
